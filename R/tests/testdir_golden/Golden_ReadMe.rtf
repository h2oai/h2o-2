\f0\fs24 \cf0 GOLDEN TEST README\
\

\b Rdoc tests (all)\
\

\b0 The doc tests are tests that take examples exactly from the R docs in both R and h2o docs. The tests exist specifically to indicate whether each example given in all docs is cut and paste runnable by users. DO NOT edit them, please. Editing the tests has the potential to create gaps in the documentation. \
\
Rdoc_NOPOASS_princcomp.R tests example in h2o.princcomp.R doc in man directory, and is associated with jira 1551\

\
GLM2 Tests	
\b0 \
\
Test: glm2:1 - tests descriptive statistics for models run in R and H2O for family binomial with factors as predictor variables. \
\
Test: glm2:2 - tests coefficients for binomial GLM in R against matching coefficients in R. \
\
Test: glm2:3 - tests that when regularization is set to 0 the model returned reflects the user defined model specification. \
\
Test: glm2:4 - tests treatment of continuous real predictors in family=Gaussian\
\
Test: glm2:5 - tests treatment of factors in vanilla glm model. Note that the omitted level CAN differ, and we DO NOT expect that the coefficients are equal in that case - only that the number of coefficients is equal, and that the model descriptive statistics are equal. \
\
Test: glm2:6 using drugs data (from http://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/linear_models/drugs1.sas with col 1 and 2 coded as integers) - tests basic regression on as.factor converted and derived dependent\
\
Test: glm2:7 tests tweedie dist on zero inflated poisson and import from url through H2O\
\
Test: glm2:9 **see glm2:10 - which addresses basic matching between glm, glmnet, and h2o glm2.\
glm2:9 runs a basic gaussian model on 2 predictors and a continuous real dependent, with regularization. does not match as of this writing. See JIRA Hex 1465)\
\
Test: glm2:10 tests non regularized glm2 against both glmnet and r\'92s standard glm. We should keep comparison to both r glm tools as a baseline for comparison as we move toward comparing regularized models\

\b \cf0 GLM1 Tests	
\b0 \
\
Test: glm1:1 - tests to outstanding jira ticket that produces NAN on null deviance for airlines - tests null deviance is numeric. NOPASS as of Jan 13, 2014\
\
Test:glm1:2 - tests whether treatment of factors in GLM1 behaves as expected for full data set, no CV or test train split on family = gaussian\
\
Test:glm1:3 - tests whether treatment of factors in GLM1 behaves as expected for full data set, no CV or test train split on family = binomial\
\
\

\b Kmeans Tests
\b0 \
\
Test: km2:1 tests vanilla kmeans by clustering on real valued cols from iris, and comparing ordered values of within cluster ss for k=3 \
\
Test: km2:2: tests vanilla kmeans by clustering on artificial data (\'93dummydata.csv\'94) with an expected answer. Tests kmeans model descriptives against expected values including the trivial k=1 case, the baseline case that is used by analysts to determine how well the partitioning of k=n accounts for variance observed.  \
\
\

\b GBM Tests\
\

\b0 Test: GBM:1 tests hand calculated MSE from H2O vector of predictions and compares to reported MSE. We have independently verified in H2O GUI that the reported MSE is calculated correctly when not passed through R. JIRA 1474\
\
Test: GBM:2 Relies on factors for prediction and binomial dependent variable - subset of Multinomial. Tests hand calculated MSE from H2O vector of predictions and compares to reported MSE. We have independently verified in H2O GUI that the reported MSE is calculated correctly when not passed through R. JIRA 1474\
