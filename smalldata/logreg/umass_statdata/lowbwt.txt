DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:

The goal of this study was to identify risk factors associated with
giving birth to a low birth weight baby (weighing less than 2500 grams).
Data were collected on 189 women, 59 of which had low birth weight babies
and 130 of which had normal birth weight babies.  Four variables which were
thought to be of importance were age, weight of the subject at her last
menstrual period, race, and the number of physician visits during the first
trimester of pregnancy.


NOTE:

This data set consists of the complete data.  A paired data set
created from this low birth weight data may be found in lowbwtm11.dat and
a 3 to 1 matched data set created from the low birth weight data may be
found in mlowbwt.dat.

PEDAGOGICAL NOTES:
        
These data have been used as an example of fitting a multiple
logistic regression model.


STORY BEHIND THE DATA:
        
Low birth weight is an outcome that has been of concern to physicians
for years. This is due to the fact that infant mortality rates and birth
defect rates are very high for low birth weight babies. A woman's behavior
during pregnancy (including diet, smoking habits, and receiving prenatal care)
can greatly alter the chances of carrying the baby to term and, consequently,
of delivering a baby of normal birth weight.
        
The variables identified in the code sheet given in the table have been
shown to be associated with low birth weight in the obstetrical literature. The
goal of the current study was to ascertain if these variables were important
in the population being served by the medical center where the data were
collected.
