Admin: Advanced Menu Selections
=====================================

Timeline: displays for the user a time ordered list of H\ :sub:`2`\ O status
events (for example, when a cluster was started). When running a multi
cluster analysis, it may happen from time to time that a node
dies. This could occur for instance, if a server goes down.
